* Bloomaway

** Introduction
   
This project will implement a basic prototype for [[http://www.novamedia.nyc/products?post=1][Bloomaway]] in WebVR. It will use the [[http://threejs.org/][THREE.js]] layer of abstraction for almost all low level graphic programming.

** Code presentation
   
The code is separated in a few files to make it easier to scale with respect to maintainability. The application mount point is index.html, and the associated javascript files are located in the js/ folder along with other THREE.js dependencies.

All javascript files are well documented, please have a look at them to grasp a better understanding of the application architecture.

*** index.html
    
Application mountpoint, it setups up the [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model][DOM]] for Bloomaway and calls the javascript files.

*** bloomaway.js

Bloomaway mountpoint. It defines the Bloomaway class and instantiates it. This is our high level application class responsible for managing scenes and cameras among other things.

The bloomaway class currently takes care of instantiating the Torus UI but this will be refactored into its own Torus class soon.

*** camera.js

Responsible for instantiating a camera which is what the user will see. This file defines a Camera class which is instantiated from the Bloomaway class. A Bloomaway class calls the camera class with parameters necessary for connecting both files since the world camera and the world are in 2 separate classes (Camera and Bloomaway respectively).

*** helpers.js

This file defines various functions helpful to the above classes but were cluttering the code too much and therefore have been refactored into their own file. Currently this file defines THREE.js abstractions for model imports more tailored to the Bloomaway classes

** TODOS

They are defined at the top of bloomaway.js and camera.js
