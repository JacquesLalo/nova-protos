** UV mapping
UV mapping are used to map textures on 3D objects easily:

Going back to the code developed for the fluid mechanics ([[./Web XR 3D fluid mecanics.pdf]]), we need to map the picture to our surface. We use UV maps to do that. Here's what it gives with 2 different UV maps:

| UV maps designed to repeat texture over surface | UV map designed to stretch texture over surface |
